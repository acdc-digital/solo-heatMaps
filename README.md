# solo-heatMaps
Solo (Solomon Powered) heatMaps is a unique daily log. Users input a variety of objectives/ personal goals/ or unique &amp; custom requirements, and begin to fill out Daily Logs based on their experiences each day. Each day is then evaluated by Solomon (Ai) and scored from 0 (Worst-day-Ever) - 100 (Best-day-Ever). The scores are reflected in a heatmap.
